# Colloquium / Speaker Series {.title}

The Stanford University Mathematical Organization hosts a weekly talk given by
a professor, grad student, or visitor about undergraduate-accessible topics in
pure and applied mathematics that go beyond the standard curriculum. The
purpose of this series is to expose undergraduates to some topics not normally
covered in the classroom, as well as to introduce them to Stanford's faculty
and community. Talks will be accessible to freshmen in the honors 50-series.

Speaker Series is held **each Thursday from 4:15 to 5:05 PM in 380-380C**
(in the basement of the math building), unless otherwise noted. Food is
provided afterwards. You can get 1 unit of credit for your attendance by
signing up for MATH 196; of course, you're also welcome to just show up.

If you have any suggestions or would like to suggest a speaker, please email
Raymond Wu at wur911@stanford.edu.
