"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow," rejoined Stubb, and with
that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented itself. The
sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in
readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and
seemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses upwardly projected from
their faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their
work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they
would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to
their nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off
at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly
filled their olfactories. Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and

# Symposium

With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like stranger
stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a little, turned and
said:&mdash;"Ye've shipped, have ye? Names down on the papers? Well, well,
what's signed, is signed; and what's to be, will be; and then again, perhaps
it won't be, after all. Anyhow, it's all fixed and arranged a'ready; and some
sailors or other must go with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men,
God pity 'em! Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless
ye; I'm sorry I stopped ye." "Look here, friend," said I, "if you have
anything important to tell us, out with it; but if you are only trying to
bamboozle us, you are mistaken in your game; that's all I have to say." "And

  it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way; you are just
  the man for him&mdash;the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates, morning! Oh!
  when ye get there, tell 'em I've concluded not to make one of 'em." "Ah, my
  dear fellow, you can't fool us that way&mdash;you can't fool us. It is the
  easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in
  him." "Morning to ye, shipmates, morning." "Morning it is," said I. "Come
  along, Queequeg, let's leave this crazy man. But stop, tell me your name,
  will you?" "Elijah." Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting,
  after each other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he
  was nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps
  above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I
  did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance.
  Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of
  his being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether the
  stranger would turn the same corner that we did. He did; and then it seemed
  to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life
  of me imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting,

# Homework Night

Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular
stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously
contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had
acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs,
substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a
ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had provided the
chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder,
which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour,
the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed
by no means in bad taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the
ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the
man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly
sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the
steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel. The perpendicular parts
of this side ladder, as is usually the case with swinging ones, were of
cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood, so that at every step
there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped
me that however convenient for a ship, these joints in the present
instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple
after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the
pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was
deposited within, leaving him impregnable in

# Math Mingle

"I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted
bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me first, twelve
rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve together like
the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I'll blow the fire." When at last
the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by spiralling them,
with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. "A flaw!" rejecting the
last one. "Work that over again, Perth." This done, Perth was about to
begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab stayed his hand, and said he
would weld his own iron. As, then, with regular, gasping hems, he hammered
on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing rods, one after the other,
and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the
Parsee passed silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed
invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up,
he slid aside. "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?"
muttered Stubb, looking on from the forecastle. "That Parsee smells fire
like a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan." At
last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as Perth,
to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by, the
scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face. "Would'st thou brand me,
Perth?" wincing for a moment with the pain; "have I been but forging my own
branding-iron, then?" "Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain
Ahab. Is not this harpoon for the White Whale?" "For the white fiend! But
now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself, man. Here are my
