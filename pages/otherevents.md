sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in
readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and
seemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses upwardly projected from

# Symposium

Every so often, we host an informal talk or discussion led by an undergraduate
or graduate student about any math-related topic of their choosing. If you're
interested in giving a talk, contact Eddy Dai at ejdai@stanford.edu. You can
talk about anything that interests you! To see a list of previous talks, see

# American Regions Math League {#arml}

[The American Regions Math League](arml.com) is one of the premier high
school math tournaments in the nation. Every year, SUMO members coach teams
from the San Francisco Bay Area and accompany the teams to the national
tournament in Las Vegas. In recent years, we have taken as many as 7 teams of 15
students to ARML. In 2013, SFBA teams placed 1st and 4th in the nation. The
next ARML will be held on May 30-31, 2014.

We hold weekly practices starting in April, and we are always looking for SUMO
members to help out at practices and go on the trip. If you're interested in
helping, email Moor Xu at annoyingpi@gmail.com.
