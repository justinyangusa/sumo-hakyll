# Symposium

Every so often, we host an informal talk or discussion led by an undergraduate
or graduate student about any math-related topic of their choosing. We've had
topics range from linear algebra to representation theory to cryptography to
mathematics in music theory.

You are welcome not only to attend these talks, but also to sign up to give a
talk yourself! You can talk about anything that interests you! If you're
interested in giving a talk, contact Eddy Dai at ejdai@stanford.edu.
  
To see a list of previous talks, see [here](/old/symposium/2013).

# American Regions Math League {#arml}

[The American Regions Math League](http://arml.com) is one of the premier high
school math tournaments in the nation. Every year, SUMO members coach teams
from the San Francisco Bay Area and accompany the teams to the national
tournament in Las Vegas. In recent years, we have taken as many as 7 teams of 15
students to ARML. In 2013, SFBA teams placed 1st and 4th in the nation. The
next ARML will be held on May 30-31, 2014.

We hold weekly practices starting in April, and we are always looking for SUMO
members to help out at practices and go on the trip. If you're interested in
helping, email Spencer Yee at spencery@stanford.edu.

# Math Mingle

Math Mingle is a fun weekly social event where students interested in math can
socialize over interesting mathematical ideas and free food in a laid-back
atmosphere. We will occasionally provide some problems and puzzles, but you are
welcome to bring in and share your own mental challenges!

Many of our officers and highly active members attend Math Mingle, so it's a
great way to start getting involved with SUMO!

Math Mingle takes place on **Fridays from 4:00 to 6:00 PM in room 380-381U**.
