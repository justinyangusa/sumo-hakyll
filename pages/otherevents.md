"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow," rejoined Stubb, and with
that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented itself. The
sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in
readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and
seemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses upwardly projected from
their faces like so many jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their
work, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they
would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to
their nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off
at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly
filled their olfactories. Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and

# Symposium

With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like stranger
stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a little, turned and
said:&mdash;"Ye've shipped, have ye? Names down on the papers? Well, well,
what's signed, is signed; and what's to be, will be; and then again, perhaps
it won't be, after all. Anyhow, it's all fixed and arranged a'ready; and some
sailors or other must go with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men,
God pity 'em! Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless
ye; I'm sorry I stopped ye." "Look here, friend," said I, "if you have
anything important to tell us, out with it; but if you are only trying to
bamboozle us, you are mistaken in your game; that's all I have to say." "And

stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a little, turned and

  it's said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way; you are just
  the man for him&mdash;the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates, morning! Oh!
  when ye get there, tell 'em I've concluded not to make one of 'em." "Ah, my
  dear fellow, you can't fool us that way&mdash;you can't fool us. It is the
  easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in
  him." "Morning to ye, shipmates, morning." "Morning it is," said I. "Come
  along, Queequeg, let's leave this crazy man. But stop, tell me your name,
  will you?" "Elijah." Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting,
  after each other's fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he
  was nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps
  above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I
  did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance.
  Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of
  his being behind, but passed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether the
  stranger would turn the same corner that we did. He did; and then it seemed
  to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could not for the life
  of me imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting,

# Homework Night

Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular
stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously
contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had
acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs,
substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a
ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had provided the
chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder,
which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour,
the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed
by no means in bad taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the
ladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the
man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly
sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the
steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel. The perpendicular parts
of this side ladder, as is usually the case with swinging ones, were of
cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood, so that at every step
there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped
me that however convenient for a ship, these joints in the present
instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple
after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the
pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was
deposited within, leaving him impregnable in

# Math Mingle

"I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted
bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me first, twelve
rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve together like
the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I'll blow the fire." When at last
the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by spiralling them,
with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. "A flaw!" rejecting the
last one. "Work that over again, Perth." This done, Perth was about to
begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab stayed his hand, and said he
would weld his own iron. As, then, with regular, gasping hems, he hammered
on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing rods, one after the other,
and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the
Parsee passed silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed
invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up,
he slid aside. "What's that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?"
muttered Stubb, looking on from the forecastle. "That Parsee smells fire
like a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket's powder-pan." At
last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as Perth,
to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by, the
scalding steam shot up into Ahab's bent face. "Would'st thou brand me,
Perth?" wincing for a moment with the pain; "have I been but forging my own
branding-iron, then?" "Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain
Ahab. Is not this harpoon for the White Whale?" "For the white fiend! But
now for the barbs; thou must make them thyself, man. Here are my
razors&mdash;the best of steel; here, and make the barbs sharp as the
needle-sleet of the Icy Sea." For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the
razors as though he would fain not use them. "Take them, man, I have no
need for them; for I now neither shave, sup, nor pray till&mdash;but
here&mdash;to work!" Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by
Perth to the shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the
blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering
them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near. "No, no&mdash;no water
for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy, there! Tashtego,
Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as much blood as
will cover this barb?" holding it high up. A cluster of dark nods replied,
Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale's
barbs were then tempered. "Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in
nomine diaboli!" deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly
devoured the baptismal blood. Now, mustering the spare poles from below,
and selecting one of hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted
the end to the socket of the

# Puzzle Hunt

"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off," he added&mdash;"come along
with ye." And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin. Seated on
the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It
turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the
largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case in
these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless
children, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or
a foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their
money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state
stocks bringing in good interest. Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many
other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by
that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon
measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously
modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same
Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are
fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance. So that there are
instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture names&mdash;a singularly
common fashion on the island&mdash;and in childhood naturally imbibing the
stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious,
daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely
blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of
character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan
Roman. And when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural
force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the
stillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest
waters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been
led to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature's
sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and
confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from
accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty
language&mdash;that man makes one in a whole nation's census&mdash;a
mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all
detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other
circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness
at the bottom of his nature. For all men tragically great are made so
through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young ambition, all
mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not to do with
such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed
peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker,
modified by individual circumstances. Like Captain Peleg, Captain
Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain
Peleg&mdash;who cared not a rush for what are called serious things,
and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all
trifles&mdash;Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated
according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his
subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island
creatures, round the Horn&mdash;all that had not moved this native born
Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his
vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common
consistency about worthy Captain Peleg. Though refusing, from
conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself
had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn
foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled
tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening
of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the
reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,
and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible
conclusion that a man's religion is one thing, and this practical world
quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little
cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a
broad shad-bellied
