## About
Student tutors are available to answer questions about Math 51, 52, and 53. The
tutors can help you with homework questions and review the material covered in
class.

This program is not aimed towards Math 50H students, but if you have questions
feel free to drop by and discuss them with the tutors.

Please remember that although tutors are here to help, they are not substitutes
for going to lecture and section. You should make every effort to go to class.
