## About
SUMO provides student tutors for the Math 50s series classes who are available
to answer questions about any of the three classes in the series. Our tutors can
help you with homework questions or review the material covered in class.

No apointment is required to attend tutoring; just show up and our tutors will
help you out. You don't even need to have questions beforehand; many students
work on their 50s homework during tutoring, asking questions when they encounter
difficulties.

This program is not aimed towards Math 50H students, but if you have questions
feel free to drop by and discuss them with our tutors.

Please remember that although tutors are here to help, they are not substitutes
for going to lecture and section. You should make every effort to go to class.
