The Stanford Math Tournament (SMT) is an annual student-run math competition
for high school students held at Stanford University. SMT aims to encourage
interest in math by providing students from around the world an opportunity to
work on fun and challenging problems and to meet other students interested in
math.

# About SMT

Stanford Math Tournament (SMT) is run by Stanford students in collaboration
with Rice University, Johns Hopkins University, and Columbia University.

Teams compete in groups of up to eight students. The contest consists of an
individual portion as well as a team portion. 

###Team Portion

The team portion consists of a team test and a power round.

The **Team Test** is a 50-minute exam consisting of 15 short answer questions.

The **Power Round** is a 90-minute exam with a series of proof-based questions
on a single topic that is revealed and briefly described at the beginning of
the round.

###Individual Portion

Students may choose to take **two individual subject
tests** in a specific topic or take a single, longer **General Test**.

The **Subject Tests** are 50-minute exams consisting of 10 short answer
questions. The subjects offered are **Advanced Topics**, **Algebra**,
  **Calculus**, and **Geometry**. The Advanced Topics test covers probability,
  number theory, and combinatorics.

The **General Test** is a 110-minute exam consisting of 25 short answer
questions that is designed for students that have less mathematical background. 

*For full rules and more detailed information, see our 2014 rules page.*

# Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

Make sure to check the rules page for detailed information regarding SMT.  If
your question is not answered below, feel free to contact the SMT coordinators
at stanford.math.tournament@gmail.com.

##Registration 

**Q: How many students may be on a team?**

A: A team may consist of one to eight students.

**Q: What should I do if I do not have enough people to form a complete team?**

A: If you are interested in joining with other incomplete teams, you can
indicate this on the registration form. You can also choose to compete as an
incomplete team. However, teams of fewer than eight students will be at a
disadvantage.  

**Q: Can I participate in SMT remotely?** 

A: No. All participants in SMT must compete at Stanford on the day of the
contest. If you cannot compete at Stanford, you may view the problems and
solutions online shortly after the conclusion of the contest.

**Q: Do students on the same team have to be from the same school?**

A: No. Traditionally, the majority of SMT teams have been comprised of students
from the same school, but this is not required. There is no limit to how many
teams a school can bring.

##Testing 

**Q: Are calculators allowed?**

A: No. Calculators are not allowed on any portion of the tests. Check the SMT
rules for information on permitted items.

**Q: Can I take only the individual test?**

A: Yes. You can choose to do so by indicating on the registration form. Your
team will not receive any points for the tests it does not take.

**Q: What topics may appear on the tests? How hard are the tests?**

A: See the [mathematical expectations](/pdfs/mathematical-expectations.pdf)
  document for guidelines on what topics may appear on each test. It is also
  advisable to look at the test from previous years in order to get a sense of
  the typical style and difficulty of SMT tests.

**Q: Which individual test should I take?**

A: If you have little or no experience with contest math, we strongly recommend
you take the General Test. Looking at past tests will help you get a sense of
the difficulty of each test.

##Logistics 

**Q: Can we purchase SMT shirts?**

A: You can order SMT shirts in the registration form. All shirt orders must be
received by the registration deadline.

**Q: Will food be provided?**

A: For lunch, you can order pizzas and drinks in the registration form. There
will also be a variety of dining options on campus. Tresidder Union will be
open. We will also provide snacks in the morning and afternoon.

**Q: Do we need to have a teacher or coach attend SMT in person?**

A: No, you are not required to have a teacher or coach at the tournament.

**Q: How do I get to the tournament location?**

A: The tournament will be located mainly in the Math Building (Building 380 in
    the Main Quad), and the awards ceremony will be in Hewlett Teaching Center
(just west of the Math Building). As the tournament date approaches, we will
send an email with campus maps and directions to all registered teams. 

**Q: My team needs to travel to reach Stanford and has to arrive the day before
and/or leave the day after the tournament. What accommodations are available
near Stanford? Is subsidized housing provided?**

A: Unfortunately, we cannot provide subsidized housing. 

**Q: Can travel to Stanford be subsidized?**

A: Unfortunately, we cannot subsidize travel to Stanford.
