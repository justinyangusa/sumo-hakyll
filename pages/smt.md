# About SMT

Stanford Math Tournament (SMT) is run by Stanford students in collaboration with Rice University, Johns Hopkins University, and Columbia University.

Teams compete in groups of up to eight students. The contest consists of an individual portion as well as a team portion. 

The team portion consists of a team test and a power round.

The **Team Test** is a 50-minute exam consisting of 15 short answer questions.

The **Power Round** is a 90-minute exam with a series of proof-based questions on a single topic that is revealed and briefly described at the beginning of the round.

Students may choose to take two individual subject tests in a specific topic or take a single, longer General Test.

The **Subject Tests** are 50-minute exams consisting of 10 short answer questions. The subjects offered are **Advanced Topics**, **Algebra**, **Calculus**, and **Geometry**.

The **General Test** is a 110-minute exam consisting of 25 short answer questions that is designed for students that have less mathematical background.
