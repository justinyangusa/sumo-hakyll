# Stanford Math Tournament Information {.title}
The Stanford Math Tournament consists of an individual contest portion and an
overall team contest between teams of up to eight students. Students take two
individual subject tests in the areas of Advanced Topics, Algebra, Calculus, and
Geometry. Alternatively, less experienced students may choose to take a single,
longer General Test. Teams participate in a Team Test and a Power Round, a
multi-part proof-oriented test.

#Registration
Registration will open on **October 1st**.

While we try to open SMT to as many participants as possible, we do have
physical contraints limiting the number of contestants. Unfortunately, with SMT
increasing in popularity in recent years, we may not be able to accomodate
everyone who would like to participate.

In light of this, available capacity is allocated based on the following
criteria:

*Time of payment* -- Registrations are not complete until registration payment is
submitted. Contestants who submit payment earlier will get priority over those
who submit later. Time of payment is based on the payment postmark date.

*Regionality* -- In order to preserve the culture and spirit of SMT, 60% of
available capacity is prioritized for contestants from California until the
registration deadline.

Do note that we are unable to issue refunds for cancelled registrations.
However, if we are unable to accomodate a contestant who has submitted payment,
we will issue a full refund.

###Deadline and Fees###
The registration deadline is on 11:59 PM Pacific time on January 20th and the
payment deadline is on January 22nd. The fee for registering teams before the
registration deadline is &#36;12 per person. Payment must be postmarked by the
payment deadline to meet the registration deadline.

Registration may be possible after the deadline, but will be subject to
availablility and a late fee.

###Payment###
Teams may pay by check, made payable to Stanford University Mathematical
Organization, or cash.

Payment must be postmarked by the payment deadline, and should be mailed to:

Stanford University Mathematical Organization  
P.O. Box 20141  
Stanford, CA 94309

###Optional Purchases###
Teams can optionally purchase pizza and soda for lunch and SMT shirts. These
can be ordered in the registration form. Pizzas are &#36;11 each. Sodas are
&#36;0.75 per can. Shirts are &#36;10 each.

The deadline for shirt orders is January 20th. The deadline for food orders is
February 2nd. Changes to shirt and food orders cannot be made after the
corresponding deadlines.

###Editing Registration Information###
Adding additional team members will be subject to availablity. If the
changes are submitted after the registration deadline or the additional payment
is sent after the payment deadline, a late fee will also be incurred for each
additional person.

The names of contestants, individual test selection, and all other
information that does not affect payment may be changed freely until the day of
the contest.

Changes to shirt or food orders cannot be made after the corresponding deadlines.

We cannot give refunds for cancelled registrations and for changes made after
the registration deadline.


#Testing
###Team Portion
The entire team will collaborate to complete the Team Test and the Power Round.
Teams may not collaborate with each other.

The **Team Test** is a 50-minute exam consisting of 15 short answer questions,
testing material from all areas of high school mathematics.

The **Power Round** is a 90-minute, multi-part, proof-oriented test. It focuses
on a single topic that will be revealed and introduced at the beginning of the
test. 

###Individual Portion
Students may choose to take two Subject Tests or take the longer General Test.
Students may not collaborate with each other on the individual tests.

The **Subject Tests** are 50-minute individual exams consisting of 10 short
answer questions. The subjects offered are Advanced Topics, Algebra, Calculus,
and Geometry. The Advanced Topics test covers probability, number theory, and
combinatorics.

The **General Test** is a 110-minute test that is designed for students with
less mathematical background. It is held at the same time as the subject area
tests and contains 25 short answer questions. 

###Tiebreakers
Anyone tied for a top three position on an individual test will qualify for a
tiebreaker. The tiebreaker will consist of three problems in the appropriate
subject area and will last for 15 minutes. Participants submit answers to the
problems as they solve them, and may answer the problems in any order.
Participants will not be informed whether they submitted a correct answer until
the end of the tiebreaker. Participants may submit multiple times for any of the
problems, but only the last submission for a given problem will be graded.

Ties are first broken in favor of the participant who answers the most questions
correctly. In the event that multiple participants solve the same number of
problems, the tie is then broken by the time of the last correct submission: the
tie is broken in favor of the participant with the earliest last correct
submission.

In the unlikely event that a tie for a top three position still stands after the
tiebreaker, we may allow the tie to stand, or we may hold a second tiebreaker
for the participants that are still tied. The second tiebreaker will consist of
one problem in the appropriate subject area. Participants may submit an answer
to the problem at any time, and will immediately be told whether the answer was
correct or incorrect. Participants may submit multiple times. The tie is broken
in favor of the participant that solves the problem earliest.

- Reference materials, such as books and notes
- Communication devices, such as cell phones and computers
- Any drawing aids not expressly permitted

#Grading
###Scoring
Scores on each round are normalized to compensate for differences in difficulty
between tests.

The procedure for score normalization is as follows. For each test, all scores
are divided by the top ten average, which is the mean of the ten highest scores.
For individual tests, the normalized scores are then multiplied by 50 for
subject tests and 50 for the general test to produce a weighted score.  This is
to make the easier general test worth approximately 50% as much as two subject
tests. An individual's total contribution to his/her team's overall score is the
sum of the weighted scores on the two subject tests he/she took, or the weighted
score on the general test. For the team and power tests, the normalized scores
are multiplied by 400 to produce a weighted score.

A team's overall score is the sum of the weighted scores on the team test, the
power test, and all of the team members' individual tests. In this way,
individual tests will be expected to contribute around 50% of a team's overall
score, and the team and power tests will each contribute around 25%. The top
scores on the team, power, and individual tests can be determined using just the
raw scores, while the final team results will be determined using this weighted
scoring system.

If your team is not taking the team test, then your overall team score will be
the same as if your team received a score of zero on the team test. It is highly
recommended that your team takes the team test in order to maximize your final
score. The same applies for the power test. Similarly, if an individual only
takes one subject test (not the general test), then the individual's
contribution to his/her team's overall score will be the same as if the
individual received a score of zero on the second subject test.

###Protests
At the conclusion of each round of the tournament, answers and solutions for
that round will be posted (in the Math Building for the individual tests and the
Power Round, and in Hewlett Teaching Center for the Team Test). If a contestant
believes that an answer key is incorrect, they must submit a protest form at
room 381T in the Math Building, or at Hewlett 200 after the Team Test. Protests
on the individual tests must be submitted by 2:30 PM, and protests on the power
round and the team test must be submitted by 3:50 PM. Decisions by the SMT
coordinators are final. 

#Awards
Prizes will be awarded to the top three scorers on each individual test, the
three highest-scoring teams on the power round, and the top three teams overall.
In addition, we will recognize the top ten scorers on each individual test and
the top ten percent of teams overall.
