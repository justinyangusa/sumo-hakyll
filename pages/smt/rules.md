# Stanford Math Tournament Rules {.title}
The Stanford Math Tournament consists of an individual contest portion and an overall team contest between teams of up to eight students. Students take two individual subject tests in the areas of Advanced Topics, Algebra, Calculus, and Geometry. Alternatively, less experienced students may choose to take a single, longer General Test. Teams participate in a Team Test and a Power Round, a multi-part proof-oriented test.

#Registration
###Deadline and Fees###
The registration deadline is on 11:59 PM Pacific time on **January 21st**, and the payment deadline is on **January 23rd**. The fee for registering teams before the registration deadline is &#36;10 per person. Registration may still be available after the registration deadline, but is subject to availability and a late fee. 

###Payment###
Teams may pay by check, made payable to the Stanford University Mathematical Organization, or cash.

Payment should be mailed to:

Stanford University Mathematical Organization  
P.O. Box 20141  
Stanford, CA 94309

###Optional Purchases###
Teams can optionally purchase pizza and soda for lunch and SMT shirts. These can be ordered in the registration form. Pizzas are &#36;11 each. Sodas are &#36;0.75 per can. Shirts are &#36;10 each.

Since we must order the food and shirts in advance of the contest, you may not place or change shirt orders after the registration deadline, and you may not place or change food orders after February 10. 

###Editing Registration Information###
All registration information may be changed freely until the registration deadline. The names of contestants, individual test selections, and all other information that does not affect payment may be changed freely until the day of the contest.

Adding additional team members will be subject to availability and a late fee for each additional person if the changes are submitted after the registration deadline or the additional payment is sent after the payment deadline. Changes to shirt or food orders cannot be made after the corresponding deadline. We cannot give refunds for changes made after the registration deadline. 




#Testing
###Team Portion
The entire team will collaborate to complete the Team Test and the Power Round. Teams may not collaborate with each other.

The **Team Test** is a 50-minute exam consisting of 15 short answer questions, testing material from all areas of high school mathematics.

The **Power Round** is a 90-minute, multi-part, proof-oriented test. It focuses on a single topic that will be revealed and introduced at the beginning of the test. 

###Individual Portion
Students may choose to take two Subject Tests or take the longer General Test. Students may not collaborate with each other on the individual tests.

The **Subject Tests** are 50-minute individual exams consisting of 10 short answer questions. The subjects offered are Advanced Topics, Algebra, Calculus, and Geometry. The Advanced Topics test covers probability, number theory, and combinatorics.

The **General Test** is a 110-minute test that is designed for students with less mathematical background. It is held at the same time as the subject area tests and contains 25 short answer questions. 

###Tiebreakers
Anyone tied for a top three position on an individual test will qualify for a tiebreaker. The tiebreaker will consist of three problems in the appropriate subject area and will last for 15 minutes. Participants submit answers to the problems as they solve them, and may answer the problems in any order. Participants will not be informed whether they submitted a correct answer until the end of the tiebreaker. Participants may submit multiple times for any of the problems, but only the last submission for a given problem will be graded.

Ties are first broken in favor of the participant who answers the most questions correctly. In the event that multiple participants solve the same number of problems, the tie is then broken by the time of the last correct submission: the tie is broken in favor of the participant with the earliest last correct submission.

In the unlikely event that a tie for a top three position still stands after the tiebreaker, we may allow the tie to stand, or we may hold a second tiebreaker for the participants that are still tied. The second tiebreaker will consist of one problem in the appropriate subject area. Participants may submit an answer to the problem at any time, and will immediately be told whether the answer was correct or incorrect. Participants may submit multiple times. The tie is broken in favor of the participant that solves the problem earliest. 

###Mathematical Expectations
See the [mathematical expectations](/pdfs/mathematical-expectations.pdf) document for guidelines on the topics that may appear on each test.

###Common Mathematical Notions
See the [common mathematical notions](/pdfs/common-mathematical-notions.pdf) document for details on mathematical conventions used at SMT.

###Acceptable Answer Formats
See the [acceptable answer formats](/pdfs/acceptable-answer-formats.pdf) document for rules on answer simplification.

###Computational Aids
The following **may** be used during the contest

- Rulers, compasses, protractors, and graph paper
- Dictionaries (for contestants who need assistance with English)

The following **may not** be used during any testing portion of the contest

- Calculators
- Other computational aids, such as slide rules and abaci
- Reference materials, such as books and notes
- Communication devices, such as cell phones and computers
- Any drawing aids not expressly permitted

#Grading
###Scoring
**Coming Soon!**

We are currently in the process of designing the scoring system for SMT 2014. 

###Protests
At the conclusion of each round of the tournament, answers and solutions for that round will be posted (in the Math Building for the individual tests and the Power Round, and in Hewlett Teaching Center for the Team Test). If a contestant believes that an answer key is incorrect, they must submit a protest form at room 381T in the Math Building, or at Hewlett 200 after the Team Test. Protests on the individual tests must be submitted by 2:30 PM, and protests on the power round and the team test must be submitted by 3:50 PM. Decisions by the SMT coordinators are final. 

#Awards
Prizes will be awarded to the top three scorers on each individual test, the three highest-scoring teams on the power round, and the top three teams overall. In addition, we will recognize the top ten scorers on each individual test and the top ten percent of teams overall. 

#Schedule

SMT 2014 will run on Saturday, February 15, 2014.
